        <h1>Deckbuilding with Untap</h1>
        <p>
            To start your first deck or a new one, go to untap.in and select the decks tab, 
            from there you can create a new deck, or edit an existing deck. Make sure to select 
            "MTG" and give your deck a name. The bar on the left will let you search for cards, 
            or select paste deck from the hamburger menu to import a decklist. </p>
            <br>
            <p>You can also select download deck and follow those instructions which can be used 
            to create a .txt file that you can copy and paste all of the cards into a comment on 
            the document below to share your deck with others. </p>
        <h1>Need Help?</h1>
        <p>Please visit this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDlXTV728cG4RyKVhSPlsQKQGS25K0RVyKpXN8PbLVg/edit#">Link</a> to copy and paste some of our favorite decks to try out yourself,
            or post your own decklists for other people to try, the list is presently a little bare,
            with only a few decks, I'd love for it to have some more on it from other people so that
            it is a more complete list with many different play styles.
        </p>
            <h1>Adjusting Power level</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout our club power level of decks has increasingly become a concern. In order to promote a more inclusive space to play magic I propose the following deckbuilding limitations:
            
                -20$ limit on commanders
                -10$ limit on each individual card in a deck
                -Proxies are allowed as long as the original cards fit the budget limits<
                -Silver-boardered cards and acorn stamped cards are allowed to help promote funny decks over powerful ones
                -Lets play some other formats too, I'd like to play a game of oathbreaker or 2-headed dragon as these formats use similar decks with different rules
                -limit 1 10 cycle infinite combo/game
                -10 min turn limit
                
                
            
            </p>
